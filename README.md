# phpBB 2 bulletin board: Unofficial maintenance branch

This repository contains various bug fixes for phpBB 2 to make it usable on recent versions of PHP. This version has been tested with PHP 8.4, but any version below that should work.

No new feature will be developed here, only bug fixes, security and performance issues. Feel free to fork this repository to build custom features on top of phpBB 2.
